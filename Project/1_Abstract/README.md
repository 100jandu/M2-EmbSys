#  Abstract
  * The Basic Idea behind the design of "SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM" project was based on the requirement to save water. Different soils and environment required different amount of water.This was the key idea considered for this project. Soil Sensor is used to detect humidity in the soil. As the humidity level goes below the required level it indicates the controller to start the water pump.
