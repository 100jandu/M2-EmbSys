#  Abstract
  * The Basic Idea behind the design of "SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM" project was based on the requirement to save water. Different soils and environment required different amount of water. This was the key idea considered for this project. Soil Sensor is used to detect humidity in the soil. As the humidity level goes below the required level it indicates the controller to start the water pump.

## What
* Smart Irrigation System with Soil sensor and water pump connected to provide water supply when needed.
---
## Where
* Designed to detect soil properties in farm lands, green houses and nurseries.
---
## When
* When the humidity level of the soil goes below the required level the circuit is triggered.
---
## Who
* Required for farmers and botanist.
---
## Why
* To save water from being wasted or to be used water wisely whenever required.
---
## How
* Soil sensor triggers the circuit as the humidity level goes below the required level.

# SWOT Analysis

| Strengths | Weakness | Opportunity | Threat |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| No human Intervention is required | System does not work with respect to weather prediction. | System can be installed in farm lands and Green Houses. | No scope to handle the system remotely if any error occured. |
